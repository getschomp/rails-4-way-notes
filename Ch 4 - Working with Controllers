The Rails 4 Way - Notes

4 - Working with Controllers

  Controllers are the heart, the first dispatch
  They are in charge of flow
  they gather info and make it avalible to the view
  keep buisness logic out of the controller and in the models
  What happens on the way to a controller action being executed and what happends as a result.

  Rack
    An modular interface for handeling web requests written in Ruby
    It abstracts ways of handeling HTTP requests
    responds with a call method
    used in sinatra and other ruby frameworks
    Rack does not really play a part in day-to-day development of applications.
    Much of the action controller is implemented as rack middleware modules
    at cli
    $ rake middleware
    will return a list of rack filers enabled for your application
