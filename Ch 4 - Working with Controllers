The Rails 4 Way - Notes

4 - Working with Controllers

  Controllers are the heart, the first dispatch
  They are in charge of flow
  they gather info and make it avalible to the view
  keep buisness logic out of the controller and in the models
  This chapter examines:
  1. What happens on the way to a controller action being executed
  2. what happens as a result.

  Rack
    An modular interface for handeling web requests written in Ruby
    It abstracts ways of handeling HTTP requests
    responds with a call method
    used in sinatra and other ruby frameworks
    Rack does not really play a part in day-to-day development of applications.
    Much of the action controller is implemented as rack middleware modules
    at cli:
    $ rake middleware
    will return a list of rack filers enabled for your application

    Configuring Your Middleware Stack

    int the config/application.rb file
    config.middleware allows you to minipulate the middleware stack
    you can control the order in which your middleware stack is configured

  4.2 Action Dispatch:Where it All Begins
    Action Dispatch - contains classes that interface the rest of the controller system to Rack.

    Request Handling

    every controller action has an implicit render
    a controller will act like it has an index method even with on omited

  4.3 Rendering
    Explicit Rendering
    You can change the default rendered view of an action

    Rendering Another Actions template
    sometimes you might specify an explicit rendering of a view to go back to the same view after an improperly submitted form
    example:
    def create
      @event = Event.new(params[:event])
      if @event.save
        redirect_to dashboard_path, notice: "Event Created!"
      else
        render action: 'new'
      end
    end

    Rendering a diffrent template all together
    render template: '/products/index.html.haml'

    Rendering a Partial Template
    allows you to organize your template code into small files
    avoids cluter and helps break up code
    Name the partial with an underscore but don't refer to it with one
    render partial: 'product' #renders app/views/products/_product.html.haml
    if you pass render partial an object it will use its class name to find a partial to render
    for instance,
    render partial: @product
    will render the same partial as
    render partial: 'product'

    Partial rendering from a controller is mostly used in conjuncation with Ajax that needs to dynammically update segments of an already displayed page.
    This will be covered in chapter 10 on action view

    Rendering Inline Template Code
    violation of MVC seperation of concerns


    Rendering Text
      send plain text back to the browser when responding to ajax
      render text: 'Submission accepted'

    Rendering other types of structured data

      JSON
      used as a way of sending data down to javascript code running in a rich web application via Ajax calls

      render json: @record

      XML
      conversiton of an object to xml
      render xml: @record

    Rendering Nothing
      head :unauthorized
      head sends a respose with no content
      or
      render nothing:true, status: 401

    Rendering options
      :content_type
      specifies what fromat you are sending to client
      :layout
      allow tou to specify name of layout template
      :status
      attach a status code
      200 OK
      201 Created
      207 Temp Redirect
      401 unauthorized
      403 forbidden - the server understood but refuses ususally because a bot is trying to trick the server
      you can tell rails to render this if the user isn't logged in, for example if the google bot
      404 - not found - the resurece may have been moved or deleted
      410 - Gone
      500 - Internal Server Error - often times a coding error
      503 - Service unavalible - site is down for maintaince

  4.4 Additional Layout Options
    you can specify a layout at the controller level if you want to reuse layouts for multiple applications

  4.5 Redirecting
    Redering is the final step in a rquest
    redirecting terminates a request and initiates a new one
    example:
    def create
        if @event.save
          flash[:notice] = "Event Created!"
          redirect_to index
        else
          render :new
        end
      end

    The redirect_to method
    redirect_to(url, staus)
    url can be expressed as a string object or action
    :back - redirects back to the page that issued the request
    assign a flash message as part of the redirect
    new to rails 4 you can add flash types
