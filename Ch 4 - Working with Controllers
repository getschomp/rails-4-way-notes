The Rails 4 Way - Notes

4 - Working with Controllers

  Controllers are the heart, the first dispatch
  They are in charge of flow
  they gather info and make it avalible to the view
  keep buisness logic out of the controller and in the models
  What happens on the way to a controller action being executed and what happends as a result.

  Rack
    An modular interface for handeling web requests written in Ruby
    It abstracts ways of handeling HTTP requests
    responds with a call method
    used in sinatra and other ruby frameworks
    Rack does not really play a part in day-to-day development of applications.
    Much of the action controller is implemented as rack middleware modules
    at cli:
    $ rake middleware
    will return a list of rack filers enabled for your application

    Configuring Your Middleware Stack

    int the config/application.rb file
    config.middleware allows you to minipulate the middleware stack
    you can control the order in which your middleware stack is configured

  4.2 Action Dispatch:Where it All Begins
    Action Dispatch - contains classes that interface the rest of the controller system to Rack.

    Request Handling

    When in doubt Render
    every controller action has an implicit render a

    Explicit Rendering
    You can change the default rendered view of an action

    Rendering another actions template
    sometimes you might explicitly render a view to go back to the same view after an improperly submitted form
