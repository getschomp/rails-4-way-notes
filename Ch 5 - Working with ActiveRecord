 tThe Rails 4 Way - Notes

5 - Working with ActiveRecord

an object encapsulates a database row
represents models and their relationships

The basics
When you create a new model class as a subclass of ActiveRecord Base Rails will implictly excpet:
  - an id column to be used as a primary key
  - pluralization conventions

conventions like naming and how foreign keys are handled are set by default but can be changed
however, it is better not to change them

!!! the server will autoreload database schema changes but in the console you must type the command: reload!
