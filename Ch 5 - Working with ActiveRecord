The Rails 4 Way - Notes

5 - Working with ActiveRecord

an object encapsulates a database row
represents models and there relationships

The basics
When you create a new model class as a subclass of ActiveRecord Base Tails will understand convensions like:
  -expect an id cloumn to be used as a primary key
  -expect pluralization conventions

stray from the "golden path" and you will get stuck in the mud
conventions like naming and how foreign keys are handled are set by default but can be changed

!!! the server will autorelod database schema changes but in the console you must type the command: reload!
