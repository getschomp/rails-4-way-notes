The Rails 4 Way - Notes

2 - Routing

  Intro
    Routing determines which conttoller and action to execute
    Routing maps urls to actions
    add ruby code to config/routes.rb to configure the routes
    'rails g' will add code to the router but you can also make custom routes

  The Two Purposes of Routing
    generates urls
    maps requests to the contoller
    HTTP_verb '(static_string)/(segment_key)' => "(controller_action mapping)"
    example: get 'recipes/:ingredient' => "recipes#index"

  The routes.rb File
    it defines routes!
    it has to go through all of the routes in the order they to recognize a pattern match for the resource rails is looking for
    (maybe good practice to put the most used resources first?)

  Regular Routes
    most basic supplies url pattern, controller/class action and HTTP method
    get 'products/:id' => 'products#show'

  Contraining request Methods
    limit the HTTP methods that can be used to acess a route
    This:
    ```get 'products/:id' => 'products#show'
        post 'products' => 'products#create'```
    is equivilent to:
      ```match 'products/:id' => 'products#show', via: [:get, :post]```
    or declare all the HTTP verbs as fair game:
      ```match 'products' => 'products#index', via: :any```

  URL Patterns
    route: get ":id" => "products#show"
    url: http://localhost:3000/8
    match" 'products/:id' => 'products#show'

  Segment keys
  in 'get 'products/:id' => 'products#show''
  :id is a segment key
